<h1> Quatar Airways </h1>
<p>Besides the use of airports to function, airlines need a website and/or app to create sales and attract potential customers.The problem with designing for airlines is that so much information has to go on the landing page – there has to be a form for inputting flight dates, and special offer information, etc. This means that when it comes to the presentation, we are mainly looking at beautiful background images, and in this regard the designers don’t disappoint. Here is a selection of such websites mainly chosen for their static or slide show background images.</p>
<center><img src="bang.jpg"></center>
<h1>Bangkok Airways</h1>
<p>This airline website uses a very different idea from all the others – a curved filmstrip-style slideshow of six beautiful images. The flight search form on the right does not interfere with any of the images as it sits over the static pattern.</p>

<center><img src="porter.jpg"></center>
<h1>Porter Airlines</h1>
<p>This airline uses a static full width image of one of their planes, with the flight search form open when you arrive at the page. You can click down the menu for Check in and Flight status that have fly-out forms, and My bookings will take you to the relevant page. The home page of this site as you scroll down has a very minimal design.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Designers and developers have solved the difficulties of text-heavy airline site design in a few different ways. These examples are among the best of the top 100 airlines of 2014, and all of them show how designers address different issues that are involved in designing a site for an airline. The main things they have had to address are: placement of flight search form, showing promotions, including beautiful images and ease of use. Airline sites probably more than most others need all of these issues solved on the landing page, and designers, as usual, have risen to the challenge admirably.
